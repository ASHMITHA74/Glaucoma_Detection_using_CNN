# Glaucoma_Detection_using_CNN
The Deep Learning Approach to Enhance Accuracy for Early Detection of Glaucoma is medical application that aims to automate the early detection of glaucoma,  leading cause of irreversible blindness. The system begins by capturing high-resolution retinal images, which are processed, analyzed using deep learning models. We got an accuracy of 98%
