# Glaucoma_Detection_using_CNN
The Deep Learning Approach to Enhance Accuracy for Early Detection of Glaucoma is a medical application that aims to automate the early detection of glaucoma, a leading cause of irreversible blindness. The system begins by capturing high-resolution retinal images, which are then processed and analysed using deep learning models specifically trained for glaucoma detection. These models can effectively detect subtle changes in the optic nerve and other relevant features associated with glaucoma, and by analysing the extracted features, the system can accurately identify and classify patients as either glaucoma suspects or non-glaucoma cases. Early detection allows for timely intervention and treatment, potentially preventing the progression of the disease and preserving vision. We achieved an accuracy of 92%.
The modules you need to import are:
Cv2, Numpy, Keras, Tensorflow, Torch, PIL, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Random, json

You can import the above by using:
pip install modulename

I have done this project in Jupyter Notebook. 
Glaucoma 1.ipynb This file contains Python code that detects glaucoma based on cup-to-disc ratio (CDR).

Glaucoma 2.ipynb This file contains Python code that detects glaucoma using the CNN model.
Here I have attached both codes along with a report and paper that we published for your reference.
We made a website for uploading retinal images that detect glaucoma. So I have attached two html files for your preview.

Here I have mentioned the link to a video that shows our project demonstration.
